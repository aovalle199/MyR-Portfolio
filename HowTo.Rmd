###**How do circadian rhythms work in a molecular level ?**

Circadian rhythms originate from self-sustained, self-regulated expressions of clock genes. This molecular mechanism consists of transcription factors that activate and deactivate genes in the nucleus of each cell, this mechanism is essential for the maintaince of a 24 hour cycle.

The molecular mechanism is initiated when the transcriptional activators _Clock_ and _Bmal1_ heterodimerize, this stimulates transcription of target circadian genes including period _Per_ and cruptochorme _Cry_ and other clock controlled genes. 
 When _Per_ and _Cry_  heterodimerize they translocate to the nucleus of the cell, here they act as  transcriptional repressors of _Clock-Bmal1_, whcih forces these genes to end the molecular circadian cycle. 
 
 Other proteins also regulate circadian rhythms, such as an enzyme sirtuin 1 _SIRT1_, histone deacetylase which removes acetyl groups and thus alters gene expression.
